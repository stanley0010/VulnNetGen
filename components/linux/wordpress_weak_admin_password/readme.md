# Wordpress

This playbook will install a WordPress website on top of a LAMP environment (**L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL and **P**HP) on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine, as explained in the guide on [How to Use Ansible to Set Up Wordpress on Ubuntu 18.04 LAMP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ansible-to-install-and-set-up-wordpress-with-lamp-on-ubuntu-18-04). 

You might want to change the settings in "files/vuln_vars.yml", e.g. mysql and wordpress's database usernames and passwords.
